# Restaurant Website Demo
A restaurant page built to practice layout and positioning using Bootstrap, jQuery and responsive design concepts.

This was a small project I built to practice design. 
It includes a general layout for a restaurant website, a business name, menu, location, social media, and other information visitors might be interested in.

## Tools and Frameworks
* Jquery
* CSS
* Bootstrap 

## Lessons Learned
* Some elements don't work well on smaller screens, but you can adjust them and, if need be, choose not to display them on smaller screens. 
* For smaller screens, it's better to test font sizes. Chrome's inspector does a great job of letting you see how your site might look on mobile devices and tablets!
* CSS variables save you a lot of time! I definitely plan to make better use of them in the future!
* If you don't like how a component looks in Bootstrap, but see that it's close to what you're looking for, try your hand at customizing it! I did this with the slider that's visible on larger screens!
* It's a good idea to over the design and concept well before you make the page. Even if it's just a sketch on paper, having all your ideas in once place makes it easier to avoid getting stuck on adjustments!
